For this project, we'll use the data from Illia Highway and cash payment. 
This project consists of two parts:

1) Initial part: Exploration of the dataset, calculate the seasonal and trend components, interpret the results, work with outliers. 
Use the dataset to predict the traffic on the Illia Highway for the last quarter of 2019.
We'll try the following predictors:
-Random Forest Regressor
-XGBoost 
-Prophet from Facebook


2) Final Part: We'll try to improve the results of the first part. Using:
-SARIMA
-LSTM

Then, we'll try to predict the traffic for the first quarter of 2020 using the models from Initial and Final Part.
